#count operation with set()   >>>>>>>> as no duplicate is permissiable, set helps to count unique characters

sentence = "apple banana apple orange banana mango"

unique = set(sentence)
print(unique) # {'r', 'l', 'a', 'p', 'e', 'm', 'o', 'n', 'b', ' ', 'g'} >> it will work on letters and space
print(len(unique)) # 11 >>> total 11 letters with 1 space

#right one for count operation
sentence = "apple banana apple orange banana mango"

words = sentence.split()       # Split sentence into words â†’ ['apple', 'banana', ...] since we want to count words not letters
unique_words = set(words)      # Convert list to set to remove duplicates
print(len(unique_words))       # 4 >>>>>>>> Count unique words
